## Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

---

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, reverse its digits while handling overflow conditions.

---

## Example 1

```
Input:  x = 123
Output: 321
```

## Example 2

```
Input:  x = -123
Output: -321
```

## Example 3

```
Input:  x = 120
Output: 21
```

## Example 4

```
Input:  x = 0
Output: 0
```

---

## Constraints

* `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

---

## Notes

* Be cautious of integer overflow when reversing.
* Check boundaries before returning the final reversed number.
* The problem specifically restricts using 64-bit integer types.
